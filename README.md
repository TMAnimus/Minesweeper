# Minesweeper
Minesweeper versions in Python and Java

Another coding interview (Amazon?) asked for an implementation of the classic game Minesweeper--specifically creating the grids. That one I think went OK, but still a little clumsy.

Again, without the time limit I was able to put together new implementations in both Java and Python.
